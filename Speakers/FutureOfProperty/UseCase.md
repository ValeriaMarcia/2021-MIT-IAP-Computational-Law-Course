# Future of Property

## Short use case description:

Section 408 of the U.S. Stafford Act allows FEMA to provide money for home repairs to owner-occupied private residences damaged by natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and wildfires. The Stafford Act defines owner-occupied residence as a home occupied by (1) the legal owner; (2) a person who does not hold formal title to the residence and pays no rent, but is responsible for the payment of taxes or maintenance of the residence; or (3) a person who has lifetime occupancy rights with formal title vested in another (44 C.F.R. § 206.111 (2018)).

However, disaster victims who do not have a proper title to their homes – and thus do not fit under the first part of the Stafford Act’s definition of owner-occupied residence – have traditionally had a difficult time proving their home occupancy and accessing FEMA aid. This was especially apparent after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017. There, FEMA rejected 75,000 housing assistance claims because applicants couldn't prove their home occupancy. Facing overwhelming aid denial rates, FEMA agreed to accept a ‘sworn statement’ (essentially an affidavit) developed by the National Low Income Housing Coalition to help individuals without titles and deeds prove owner-occupancy.

Per the ABA journal: “In the declarative statement, people needed to swear that no other person can claim ownership rights to the property or that after an effort to locate rightful owners they could not be found. The owner was encouraged to provide alternative documentation instead of a title such as tax receipts, home insurance, a utility bill, a letter of credit from the utility company, receipts from repairing the property, or any other documentation that would support that they were currently occupying and maintaining the home.”

However, the availability of this sworn statement was not well publicized and few Puerto Ricans ended up using it. And, because the sworn statement is not a FEMA document, FEMA has not taken steps to mainstream it to other disasters.

Since Hurricane Maria, multiple legal aid organizations, including Ayuda Legal Puerto Rico, have called on FEMA to expand what it accepts as proof of owner-occupancy. A few other U.S. jurisdictions, including Texas and Connecticut, have expanded the ways in which residents can prove owner-occupancy, however these practices have also not been streamlined.

We believe that as Americans’ social and economic lives move online, and as more Americans carry smartphones, their digital trails can be used to prove many things about them, including long-term home occupancy. We would like to explore the case for expanding the types of evidence FEMA accepts as proof of owner-occupancy to include digital footprints. We’d be interested in understanding how such an expansion could be accomplished from a legal standpoint and also from a technological standpoint.
