# 2021 IAP Computational Law Workshop Course
> **Instructors** - [Dazza Greenwood](https://civics.com/about-dazza-greenwood), [Bryan Wilson](http://connection.mit.edu/bryan-wilson)
> **Teaching Assistants** - Andrew Domzalski, Megan Ma

This workshop course provides a conceptual overview and optional hands-on projects for understanding and solving legal use cases with data analytics, blockchain or other cryptosystems and a special module on rapid design solutions to key challenges posed by invited speakers. The course includes seminar-style lecture, class discussion, readings and other informational resources, and optional sessions hands-on, experiential learning through class projects. All class sessions and activities will be virtual and available through links provided to students shortly before the first class.

## Course Goal(s)
Provide an overview of Computational Law with readings and materials from the [MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu/) and selected deeper dives into special topics.

## Course Live Sessions

During the course, we will hear from a different subject-matter experts in computational law and practice. In the coming weeks, we will continue updating this page with more information about each speaker and materials from their lectures.

Please reserve an hour the week before each class to review class materials in advance of the class discussions that week. Class projects are optional and will include additional time outside of class. Class topics may change. 

### Computational Law and Data Supply Chains

**Jan/08, Fri 12:00PM-01:00PM**	

> Dazza Greenwood of MIT Media Lab and Professor David Restrepo Amariles of HEC Paris where he is director of research on Legal Metrics and SMART Law (Scientific Mathematical, Algorithmic, Risk and Technology-driven law) will discuss Opportunities for Using Computational Law to Audit Data Supply Chains. Bryan Wilson, an MIT Fellow, will provide students with an optional opportunity to do a hands-on class project.

### Computational Law and Standards

**Jan/15, Fri, 12:00PM-01:00PM**	

> Dazza Greenwood of MIT Media Lab and Kenneth Jones, Chief Technologist of Tanenbaum Keale LLP, will discuss key technical standards for legal data and interactions, from ANSI X12 EDIFACT to the SALI Alliance's emerging Legal Matter Standard Specification (LMSS) and how these standards provide a foundation for innovative computational law systems. Bryan Wilson, an MIT Fellow, will update optional hands-on class projects.

### Computational Law and Property Ownership

**Jan/22, Fri, 12:00PM-01:00PM**

> Dazza Greenwood of MIT and Yuliya Panfil, senior fellow and director of New Americas Future of Property Rights program, will ask whether or how computational law could afford better methods and mechanisms for proving ownership of property in post-disaster and other emergency scenarios. Bryan Wilson, an MIT Fellow, will provide students with an optional opportunity to do a hands-on class project.

### Computational Arbitration and Space Law

**Jan/29, Fri, 12:00PM-01:00PM**

> Dazza Greenwood of MIT and Vivasvat Dadwal (Viva) attorney at King & Spalding and co-organizer of New York Legal Hackers, will discuss current and emerging arbitration trends in disputes involving the law of space and the moon and ask whether or how computational law could meet the growing challenges. Bryan Wilson, an MIT Fellow, will provide students with an optional opportunity to do a hands-on class project.


## Optional Course Projects
Projects are completely optional. Class projects will be an experimental attempt to adapt the project format of MIT's Media Ventures course.  Students seeking to submit a class project will complete a list of assignments posted ahead of each class sesssion. Students can then coordinate with Bryan for a 1-on-1 sessions, as needed, to discuss projects during the IAP period. Participants will have the option to present a Computational Law project in the final class period. Projects may include one or more of the following:

* **Abstract** - write about an impactful aspect of Computational Law
* **Roadmap** - create a plan for how to develop a Computational Law Venture
* **Prototype** - build a proof-of-concept application
